# plugin will add newly discovered shard names/ports to bungee's list of available servers so they don't have to be added to bungee/config.yml
# Note that this will not add anything to bungee's config.yml. This means the server list will reset to that config file each restart, and
# servers will be registered as they check in via heartbeat after a restart.
